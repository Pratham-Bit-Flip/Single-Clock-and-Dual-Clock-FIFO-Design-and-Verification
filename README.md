# Single-Clock and Dual-Clock FIFO Design and Verification

## FIFO Design in Verilog

This repository contains two FIFO implementations and their testbenches:

- **Single-Clock FIFO** – Synchronous design using one clock for both read and write.
- **Dual-Clock FIFO** – Asynchronous design with independent read/write clocks .
